        "\n",
        "\"\"\"Q1. What are data structures, and why are they important?\n",
        "-Data structures are ways of organizing and storing data so it can be accessed and modified efficiently.\n",
        "They are important because they improve performance, memory usage, and code clarity, especially when handling large amounts of data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q2. Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples\n",
        "-Mutable data types can be changed after creation, while immutable data types cannot.\n",
        "For example, lists are mutable ([1,2,3] can be modified), whereas strings and tuples are immutable (\"abc\" and (1,2,3) cannot be changed).\n",
        "\n",
        "Q3. What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n",
        "-Lists are mutable and written using square brackets [], while tuples are immutable and written using parentheses ().\n",
        "Lists are suitable for dynamic data, whereas tuples are used for fixed, constant data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q4. Describe how dictionaries store data\n",
        "-Dictionaries store data in key–value pairs, where each key is unique and maps to a specific value.\n",
        "Internally, dictionaries use a hash table for fast data access.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q5. Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n",
        "-Sets automatically remove duplicate elements and allow faster membership testing.\n",
        "They are useful when uniqueness and performance are more important than order.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n",
        "-A string is an immutable sequence of characters, while a list is a mutable sequence of elements.\n",
        "Unlike lists, individual characters in a string cannot be modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n",
        "-Tuples are immutable, meaning their contents cannot be altered once created.\n",
        "This prevents accidental changes and helps maintain data consistency.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n",
        "-A hash table is a data structure that stores data using a hash function for fast access.\n",
        "Python dictionaries are implemented using hash tables, enabling constant-time average lookups.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?\n",
        "-Yes, lists can store multiple data types such as integers, strings, floats, and even other lists.\n",
        "Example: [1, \"Python\", 3.5, [2,3]].\n",
        "\n",
        "Q10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python\n",
        "-Strings are immutable to improve performance, memory efficiency, and security.\n",
        "Once created, a string cannot be changed, so any modification creates a new string.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q11. What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n",
        "-Dictionaries provide faster data retrieval using keys instead of index searching.\n",
        "They are ideal when data needs to be accessed using unique identifiers.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list\n",
        "-Tuples are preferred when storing constant data such as coordinates (x, y) or fixed configuration values.\n",
        "Their immutability prevents accidental modification.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n",
        "-Sets automatically eliminate duplicate values.\n",
        "If duplicate elements are added, only one instance is stored.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. How does the in keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n",
        "-In a list, in checks for the presence of a value.\n",
        "In a dictionary, in checks only for the presence of a key, not a value.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q15. Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not\n",
        "-No, tuple elements cannot be modified because tuples are immutable.\n",
        "This design ensures data safety and integrity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q16. What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case\n",
        "-A nested dictionary is a dictionary that contains another dictionary as a value.\n",
        "It is commonly used to store structured data like student records or JSON data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary\n",
        "-Accessing elements in a dictionary has an average time complexity of O(1).\n",
        "This is due to its hash table implementation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q18. In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n",
        "-Lists are preferred when order matters and elements are accessed by index.\n",
        "They are ideal for sequential data and repeated iteration.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n",
        "-Dictionaries are conceptually unordered because data is accessed by keys, not position.\n",
        "This means retrieval is fast but not based on index order.\n",
        "\n",
        "Q20. Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval\n",
        "-Lists retrieve data using index positions, which may require searching.\n",
        "Dictionaries retrieve data using keys, allowing faster and more efficient access.\"\"\""
